Stock Price Prediction with LSTM (Flask Application)
Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction repository! This project showcases a Flask-based web application that predicts stock prices using historical data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. It is designed for research and learning purposes, providing insights into time-series forecasting with deep learning.

Features
Historical Data Retrieval: Automatically fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
Deep Learning Model: Implements an LSTM model to capture and predict stock price trends.
Data Visualization: Generates interactive prediction graphs that compare actual and predicted stock prices.
RESTful API: Offers a Flask endpoint to receive stock tickers and return prediction results.
Cross-Origin Support: Enabled via Flask-CORS for front-end integration.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or above
Libraries: flask, tensorflow, yfinance, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, flask-cors
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
Run the Flask App:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Make Predictions: Send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with a JSON payload:

json
Copy code
{
    "ticker": "AAPL"
}
The API will return a PNG image of the prediction graph.

Testing Predictions
Future Directions
Add support for real-time stock data.
Integrate sentiment analysis from news or social media.
Enhance the LSTM model using advanced architectures (e.g., GRU, Transformer).
Develop a user-friendly front-end dashboard.
